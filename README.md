# Multi-State-Models

We propose a novel approach using multi-state semi-Markov models to investigate road user interaction behaviors. Road user behavior can be divided into a series of gap acceptance decisions as part of a Markov Chain. 
Each gap acceptance decision is modeled as a specific transition between two states in the Markov Chain. The modeling work is interesting and promising for future work in more sophisticated analysis of time-varying effects and chains of events or decisions.
